# tip4p_water_model_nacl_aqueous_solution

This repository contains Python scripts used to analyse density and shear viscosity data for aqueous NaCl solutions modelled with the tip4p water model. The main goal is to study the temperature dependence of the solution density at different molalities and to compare the behaviour across concentration.
